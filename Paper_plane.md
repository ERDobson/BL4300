Take one piece of 8.5x11 paper.  Any color will work fine.
Lay the paper down so it is 11 inches LONG and 8.5 inches high.
Fold the paper in half from top to bottom. 
Fold just one of the two paper layers on the left side of the paper so that the "vertical" edge now matches up with the bottom. It should form an isosceles triangle.
Flip the paper over and make a similar triangle on the opposite side.  
Fold the top edge over until it falls half way down the long side, and again do the same on the opposite side.  
Then keeping the sides quite flat, bend the "tail" of the paper sides up into a more horizontal position.
Happy Flying!
